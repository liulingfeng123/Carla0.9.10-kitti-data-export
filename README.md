# Carla0.9.10-kitti-data-export
Using Carla to make data set similar to Kitti 3D target detection 

Thanks for @Fredrik00's work: https://github.com/Ozzyz/carla-data-export

Due to the change of Carla API, this work is aimed at Carla 0.9.10. 

You can get the 3D bbox and lidar data of the vehicle in the Kitti coordinate systemã€‚
