        bin is used for KITTI-data format, while .ply is the regular point cloud format
        In Unreal, the coordinate system of the engine is defined as, which is the same as the lidar points
        z
        ^   ^ x
        |  /
        | /
        |/____> y
        This is a left-handed coordinate system, with x being forward, y to the right and z up
        See also https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/498
        However, the lidar coordinate system from KITTI is defined as
              z

        Which is a right handed coordinate sylstem
        Therefore, we need to flip the y axis of the lidar in order to get the correct lidar format for kitti.

            Carla: X   Y   Z
            KITTI: X  -Y   Z
